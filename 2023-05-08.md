# Transport
- local transport
 - server and client in the same jvm 
 - not accept real network traffic
 

# ByteBuf
- backed array vs direct buffer
- if data were in heap-allocated buffer, jvm would copy them into direct buffer internally...but what about backed array?
- readerIndex, writerIndex
- derived buffer
    - share the internal storage which means if the derived is modified, the original also gets modified as well. why? due to cost of copying memory
    - use copy() method as to handle instances independently
